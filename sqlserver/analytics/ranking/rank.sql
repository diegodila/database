/*
 RANK() gives you the ranking within your ordered partition. Ties are assigned the same rank, with the next ranking(s) skipped. So, if you have 3 items at rank 2, the next rank listed would be ranked 5.

 DENSE_RANK() again gives you the ranking within your ordered partition, but the ranks are consecutive. No ranks are skipped if there are ranks with multiple items.

 basicamente o rank pula os numeros consecutivos ex. classif. 1, 1, 3, e dense_rank n√£o ex: 1,1,2
